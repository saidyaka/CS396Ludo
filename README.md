# CS396Ludo
This robot emulates and tries to copy the movement of a minecraft pig character, it hops similar to one after being fed in the game 
 the fitness function calcualtes how far the pig gets from the starting area walking into the screen, but also its important to note that the way it moves makes it very easy to tip forward so in a lot of the lower fitness versions it rolls over and in the higher ones it does not and it hops around successfully

 git pull and branch into finalProject and simply type 

 Python3 Search.py

 to run
